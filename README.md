# AI Agent Experiments

This repository contains experiments and projects exploring different approaches to building AI Agents or LLM Powered applications.

## Projects

### [Code Execution Agent](./code-execution/README.md)

An intelligent LLM agent that executes TypeScript code and interacts with external capabilities. This project explores code-based capabilities for LLMs - giving AI agents the ability to write and execute code to accomplish tasks, rather than calling pre-defined tool functions directly.

**Key Features:**

- Dynamic TypeScript code execution using Bun
- Extensible capabilities system with automatic discovery
- Interactive CLI with streaming responses
- Built with LangChain, LangGraph, and OpenAI GPT models

### OpenAI Models

Experiments with OpenAI models and API usage patterns.
